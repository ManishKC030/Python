# OOP stands fot Object Oriented Programming.
# It is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design applications and programs.


# Classes and Objects

# Class:
#   - A blueprint or a template for creating objects is called class.
#Class is always written in PascalCase.

#To create a 'class', use the keyword "class".

class MyClass :
    x=5   #we created class MyClass with Property named X.

#Now we can use class to create objects.
#Object is an instance of a class.
#Object is created using the class name.
#Object is always written in camelCase.

obj = MyClass()  #we created object obj from class MyClass.
print(obj.x)  #we printed the value of property X of object obj.
