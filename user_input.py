# In Python, you can get input from the user using the built-in input() function.
# The input() function returns a string, so you need to convert it to datatype as your wish
# For example, if you want to get an integer from the user, you can use int()

a = input("Enter your message:")

b= int(input("enter your number:"))
print(b)
