x = 5 #this is integer
y = "Hello"  # this is a string (you can use single or double quote)


#If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

x = str(3) # x will be '3' as it is a string
y = int(3) # y will be 3 
z = float(3) # z will be 3.0 (gives decimal value too)


# variable names are case-sensitive. so, 

a = 5
#this a is different from A.
