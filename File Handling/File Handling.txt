 File handling in python is a way to manipulate the files.
 It includes reading, writing, and modifying the files.

Python provides a built in Open() function to work with files.
 The Open() function opens and returns a file object, which takes 2 arhuments:
    1. The name of the file to be opened
    2. The mode in which the file is to be opened.


#Here are some of the modes
 'r'	Read-only mode (default). File must exist.
 'w'	Write mode. Creates or overwrites the file.
 'a'	Append mode. Adds data to the end of the file.
 'x'	Exclusive creation. Fails if file exists.
 't'	Text mode (default). Used with 'rt', 'wt', etc.
 'b'	Binary mode. Used with 'rb', 'wb', etc.
