#set is an collection of unique elements
#set is  unordered collection
#set can have any data types.
#it is just like sets you studied in maths.

my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(my_set)  #output: {1, 2, 3}

# to create empty set
empty_set = set()
#dont use set = {} as it will create dictionary
print (empty_set)

e = {1,2,2,3,3,4}
print(e)  #output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
#elements are not repeated in sets
